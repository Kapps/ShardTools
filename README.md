Basic tools repository, intended to contain no required dependencies and be simple to incorporate into any project. No API stability is guaranteed as this is primarily for personal use, however all code is licensed as Boost so feel free to use anything that may be useful. In general, fully untested classes are marked @disabled, but the library is far from mature.
